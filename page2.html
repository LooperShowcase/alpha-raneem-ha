        The G-class was developed as a military vehicle from a suggestion by the
        Shah of Iran (at the time a significant Mercedes shareholder) to
        Mercedes[6] and was offered as a civilian version in 1979. In this role
        vehicle was sometimes referred to as the "Wolf". The Peugeot P4 was a
        variant made under licence in France with a Peugeot engine. The first
        military in the world to use it was the Argentine Army (Ejército
        Argentino) beginning in 1981 with the military model 461, at least one
        of these was captured in the Falklands and subsequently served with the
        Royal Air Force.[7] The development of the G-Class started in 1972 with
        a cooperative agreement between Daimler-Benz and Steyr-Daimler-Puch in
        Graz, Austria. Mercedes-Benz engineers in Stuttgart were in charge of
        design and testing, while the team in Graz developed the production
        plans. The first wooden model was presented to Daimler-Benz management
        in 1973, with the first drivable prototype beginning various testing
        including German coalfields, the Sahara Desert, and the Arctic Circle in
        1974. Construction commenced on a new production facility in Graz, where
        the new cross-country vehicle would be assembled nearly entirely by hand
        in 1975, with production of the "G Model" beginning in Graz in 1979. In
        1980, the Vatican took delivery of a specially made G-Wagen outfitted
        with a clear thermoplastic top which served as the Popemobile. The “Papa
        G” later took up permanent residence at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in
        Stuttgart, Germany.[citation needed] The first major refinements were
        introduced in 1981, including an automatic transmission, air
        conditioning, an auxiliary fuel tank, protective headlamp grilles and a
        cable winch. Fuel injection became available in 1982, when the 230 GE
        was introduced in Turin,[8] along with more comfortable and supportive
        front seats, auxiliary heating, wider tires and fender flares. For 1985,
        differential locks, central door locking and a tachometer became
        standard and by 1986 over 50,000 G Models had been produced.[citation
        needed] The G-Wagen was facelifted in 1990. In 1989, for the 10th
        anniversary of the G Model, a new model variant with permanent 4-wheel
        drive, a wood-trimmed interior and optional Anti-lock Braking System
        (ABS) debuted at the Frankfurt International Motor Show. Production
        began the following April. For 1992, production began on a new
        sub-series for professional users. The civilian model began to offer
        cruise control, a stainless-steel spare-tire cover, running boards and
        Burl Walnut wood interior trim. In the same year, the 100,000th G Model
        was built in Graz and in 1994, the model line was officially renamed the
        G-Class. Ventilated front disc brakes and a driver's air bag became
        standard. In 1996 the automatic transmission became an electronically
        controlled 5-speed unit and headlamp washers, cruise control, and a
        front passenger's air bag were added. In 1998, the range-topping G 500
        with a 296 hp V8 was introduced for series production.[citation needed]
        For 1999 a limited run of V8 powered "G 500 Classic" special editions
        marked the model's 20th anniversary. A multifunction steering wheel was
        added to all models. Later in the year, the new G 55 AMG debuted as the
        most powerful G-Class yet, with 354 hp. The U.S. market launch of the
        G-Class took place in 2001. New alloy wheels, a chrome grille and
        body-colour bumpers plus a more luxurious cabin were introduced. New
        dynamic control systems included the Electronic Stability Program (ESP),
        Brake Assist, and the 4 wheel Electronic Traction System (4 ETS). The G
        55 AMG was upgraded in 2004 with a supercharged V8 engine developing 476
        hp.[citation needed] In 2006, a documentary filmmaker was the first
        foreigner to reach Siberia, the world's coldest region, with a passenger
        vehicle in winter, driving a stock G 500 nearly 19,000 km without a
        single breakdown, in temperatures as frigid
